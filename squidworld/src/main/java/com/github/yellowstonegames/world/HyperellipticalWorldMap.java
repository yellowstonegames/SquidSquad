/**
 * A concrete implementation of {@link WorldMapGenerator} that projects the world map onto a shape that resembles a
 * mix part-way between an ellipse and a rectangle. This is an equal-area projection, like EllipticalWorldMap, so effects that fill
 * areas on a map like PoliticalMapper will fill (almost) equally on any part of the map. This has less
 * distortion around all the edges than the other maps here, especially when comparing the North and South poles
 * with RoundSideWorldMap. This uses the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler_hyperelliptical_projection">Tobler hyperelliptical projection</a>.
 * <br>
 * This is my (Tommy Ettinger's) personal favorite projection here, because it can be close enough to the familiar
 * rectangular map projections used in many atlases, while still keeping the poles as single points and minimizing most
 * kinds of shape distortion. Thank you, Waldo Tobler, RIP.
