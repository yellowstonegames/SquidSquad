/** An indirect priority queue.
 *
 * <p>An indirect priority queue provides a way to {@linkplain #enqueue(int)
 * enqueue} by index elements taken from a given <em>reference list</em>,
 * and to {@linkplain #dequeue() dequeue} them in some specified order.
 * Elements that are <em>smaller</em> in the specified order are
 * dequeued first. It
 * is also possible to get the {@linkplain #first() index of the first element}, that
 * is, the index that would be dequeued next.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, the queue may provide a method to peek at the index of the
 * element that would be dequeued {@linkplain #last() last}.
 *
 * <p>The reference list should not change during queue operations (or, more
 * precisely, the relative order of the elements corresponding to indices in the queue should not
 * change). Nonetheless, some implementations may give the caller a way to
 * notify the queue that the {@linkplain #changed() first element has changed its
 * relative position in the order}.
 *
 * <p>Optionally, an indirect priority queue may even provide methods to notify
 * {@linkplain #changed(int) the change of <em>any</em> element of the
 * reference list}, to check {@linkplain #contains(int) the presence of
 * an index in the queue}, and to {@linkplain #remove(int) remove an index from the queue}.
 * It may even allow to notify that {@linkplain #allChanged() all elements have changed}.
 *
 * <p>It is always possible to enqueue two distinct indices corresponding to
 * equal elements of the reference list. However, depending on the
 * implementation, it may or may not be possible to enqueue twice the same
 * index.
 *
 * <p>Note that <em>all element manipulation happens via indices</em>.
