/**
 * A substitute for the UUID class, since it isn't available on GWT.
 * The typical usage is to call {@link #next()} when you want a new UniqueIdentifier. If the app is closing down and
 * needs to save its state to be resumed later, {@link #GENERATOR} must be serialized as well, and deserialized before
 * calling {@link #next()} again after resuming. Without this last step, the generated identifiers are <em>extremely
 * likely</em> to be unique, but not <em>guaranteed</em> to be unique.
 * <br>
 * This can be serialized out-of-the-box to Strings using {@link #stringSerialize()}, but if you do, so must the
 * {@link #GENERATOR} that produces new UniqueIdentifier instances and ensures they are unique.
 * If you are using Fury or another type of serializer that can use {@link Externalizable} objects, this can be sent
 * directly to that without needing any extra serialization code. Like with the String serialization, you must serialize
 * the {@link #GENERATOR} field and restore it when restarting from a serialized state. The methods from Externalizable
 * are marked as {@link GwtIncompatible}; if you compile targeting GWT, they will not be present in the generated JS
 * code. The GwtIncompatible annotation and the {@code Base} class (in digital) are all this uses from other code.
 * <br>
 * This is also Comparable, for some reason (UUID is, but since these should all be random, it doesn't mean much).
 * UniqueIdentifier supports up to 2 to the 128 minus 1 unique instances, which should be far more than enough for
 * centuries of generation. If you were using UUID, it only supports 2 to the 122 unique random UUIDs, with a collision
 * 50% likely after 2 to the 61 UUIDs were generated. If this is used properly, it can't collide until all (2 to the 128
 * minus 1) identifiers have been generated.
