     * A variation on {@link Math#cos(double)} that takes its input as a fraction of a turn instead of in radians (it
     * also takes and returns a float); one turn is equal to 360 degrees or two*PI radians. This can be useful as a
     * building block for other measurements; to make a cosine method that takes its input in grad (with 400 grad equal
     * to 360 degrees), you would just divide the grad value by 400.0 (or multiply it by 0.0025) and pass it to this
     * method. Similarly for binary degrees, also called brad (with 256 brad equal to 360 degrees), you would divide by
     * 256.0 or multiply by 0.00390625 before passing that value here. The brad case is especially useful because you
     * can use a byte for any brad values, and adding up those brad values will wrap correctly (256 brad goes back to 0)
     * while keeping perfect precision for the results (you still divide by 256.0 when you pass the brad value to this
     * method).
     * <br>
     * The error for this float version is extremely close to the float version, {@link #cos_(double)}, so you should
     * choose based on what type you have as input and/or want to return rather than on quality concerns. Coercion
     * between float and double takes about as long as this method normally takes to run (or longer), so if you have
     * floats you should usually use methods that take floats (or return floats, if assigning the result to a float),
     * and likewise for doubles.
