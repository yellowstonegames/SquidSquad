/**
 * Preconfigured static {@link Font} instances, with any important metric adjustments already applied. This uses the
 * {@link com.github.tommyettinger.textra.KnownFonts} class from textratypist, which is also the dependency that
 * provides Font here. All of the {@code getXyz()} methods that return some Font {@code Xyz} here are very simple; they
 * call the method of the same name in textratypist to get a Font (which is cached inside textratypist and copied to get
 * the returned value), set a {@link com.github.tommyettinger.textra.ColorLookup} on that Font so the syntax from
 * {@link com.github.yellowstonegames.core.DescriptiveColor#describe(CharSequence)} can be used, and return the modified
 * Font. If you use the KnownFonts class from textratypist, each Font will still work, but you have to use colors known
 * by {@link com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Colors} if you look them up by name, and can't modify lightness or saturation.
 * <br>
 * Typical usage involves calling one of the static methods like {@link #getCozette()} or {@link #getGentium()} to get a
 * particular Font. This knows a fair amount of fonts, but it doesn't require the image assets for all of those to be
 * present in a game -- only the files mentioned in the documentation for a method are needed, and only if you call that
 * method. It's likely that many games would only use one font file, and so would generally only need a .fnt file, a
 * .png file, and some kind of license file. They could ignore all other assets required by other fonts.
 * <br>
 * There are some special features in Font that are easier to use with parts of this class. {@link #getStandardFamily()}
 * pre-populates a FontFamily so you can switch between different fonts with the {@code [@Sans]} syntax.
 * {@link #addEmoji(Font)} adds all of Twitter's emoji from the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji">Twemoji</a>
 * project to a given font, which lets you enter emoji with the {@code [+man scientist, dark skin tone]} syntax or the
 * generally-easier {@code [+üë®üèø‚Äçüî¨]} syntax. If you want to use names for emoji, you may want to consult "Twemoji.atlas"
 * for the exact names used; some names changed from the standard because of technical restrictions.
 * <br>
 * There's some documentation for every known Font, including a link to a preview image and a listing of all
 * required files to use a Font. The required files include any license you need to abide by; this doesn't necessarily
 * belong in the {@code assets} folder like the rest of the files! Most of these fonts are either licensed under the OFL
 * or some Creative Commons license; the CC ones typically require attribution, but none of the fonts restrict usage to
 * noncommercial projects.
 * <br>
 * The links to required font files (.fnt, .png, in at least one case .font, and various forms of license documents) go
 * to the <a href="https://github.com/tommyettinger/textratypist">textratypist repo</a> and its assets, rather than the
 * copies here. Because this class just wraps textratypist now, if there's a problem with some asset or its
 * configuration, you can update the textratypist dependency in your project and use the most recent (and hopefully
 * fixed) font files from that repo. This may be more reliable than using duplicate font files from SquidSquad's repo,
 * since those might not be as up-to-date.
