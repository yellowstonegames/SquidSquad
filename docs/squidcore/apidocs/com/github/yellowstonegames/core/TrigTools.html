<div class="block">A fairly-close approximation of <code>Math.sin(double)</code> that can be significantly faster (between 8x and 80x
 faster sin() calls in benchmarking; if you have access to libGDX you should consider its sometimes-more-precise
 and sometimes-faster MathUtils.sin() method. Because this method doesn't rely on a
 lookup table, where libGDX's MathUtils does, applications that have a bottleneck on memory may perform better
 with this method than with MathUtils. Takes the same arguments Math.sin() does, so one angle in radians,
 which may technically be any double (but this will lose precision on fairly large doubles, such as those that are
 larger than <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>, because those doubles themselves will lose precision at that scale). The
 difference between the result of this method and <code>Math.sin(double)</code> should be under 0.0011 at
 all points between -pi and pi, with an average difference of about 0.0005; not all points have been checked for
 potentially higher errors, though.
 <br>
 The error for this double version is extremely close to the float version, <a href="#sin(float)"><code>sin(float)</code></a>, so you should
 choose based on what type you have as input and/or want to return rather than on quality concerns. Coercion
 between float and double takes about as long as this method normally takes to run (or longer), so if you have
 floats you should usually use methods that take floats (or return floats, if assigning the result to a float),
 and likewise for doubles.
 <br>
 Unlike in previous versions of this method, the sign of the input doesn't affect performance here, at least not
 by a measurable amount.
 <br>
 The technique for sine approximation is mostly from
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228213915/http://devmaster.net/forums/showthread.php?t=5784">this archived DevMaster thread</a>,
 with credit to "Nick". Changes have been made to accelerate wrapping from any double to the valid input range.</div>

<div class="block">Altered-range approximation of the frequently-used trigonometric method atan2, taking y and x positions as floats
 and returning an angle measured in turns from 0.0f to 1.0f, with one cycle over the range equivalent to 360
 degrees or 2PI radians. You can multiply the angle by <code>6.2831855f</code> to change to radians, or by <code>360f</code>
 to change to degrees. Takes y and x (in that unusual order) as floats. Will never return a negative number, which
 may help avoid costly floating-point modulus when you actually want a positive number.

 handy information that makes this approach usable. Note that
 <a href="#atan2(float,float)"><code>atan2(float, float)</code></a> returns an angle in radians and can return negative results, which may be fine for
 many tasks; these two methods are extremely close in implementation and speed.</div>

<div class="block">Close approximation of the frequently-used trigonometric method atan2, with higher precision than libGDX's atan2
 approximation, and giving a result in degrees from -180 to 180. Maximum error is below 0.1 degrees.
 Takes y and x (in that unusual order) as doubles, and returns the angle from the origin to that point in degrees.
 It is about 5 times faster than <code>Math.atan2(double, double)</code> (roughly 17 ns instead of roughly 88 ns for
 Math, though the computer was under some load during testing). It is almost identical in speed to libGDX'
 MathUtils approximation after converting to degrees; MathUtils seems to have worse average error, though.
