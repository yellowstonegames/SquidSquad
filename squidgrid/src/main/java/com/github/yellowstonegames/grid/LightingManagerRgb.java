/**
 * A convenience class that makes dealing with multiple colored light sources easier.
 * All fields are public and documented to encourage their use alongside the API methods. The typical usage case for
 * this class is when a game has complex lighting needs that should be consolidated into one LightingManager per level,
 * where a level corresponds to a {@code char[][]}. After constructing a LightingManager with the resistances for a
 * level, you should add all light sources with their positions, either using {@link #addLight(int, int, Radiance)} or
 * by directly putting keys and values into {@link #lights}. Then you can calculate the visible cells once lighting is
 * considered (which may include distant lit cells with unseen but unobstructing cells between the viewer and the light)
 * using {@link #calculateFOV(Coord)}, which should be called every time the viewer moves. You can update the flicker
 * and strobe effects on all Radiance objects, which is typically done every frame, using {@link #update()} or
 * {@link #updateAll()} (updateAll() is for when there is no viewer), and once that update() call has been made you can
 * call {@link #draw(int[][])} to change a 2D int array that holds packed int colors (such as the backgrounds in a
 * GlyphMap). To place user-interface lighting effects that don't affect the in-game-world lights, you can use
 * {@link #updateUI(Coord, Radiance)}, which is called after {@link #update()} but before {@link #draw(int[][])}.
 * <br>
 * This class uses the normal RGBA color space, like {@link DescriptiveColorRgb}, for almost every place it deals with
 * color. The exception here is {@link #drawOklab(int[][])}, which uses RGBA internally but converts the colors to OKlab
 * when it outputs them.
 * <br>
 * Honestly, this class is quite complex, and you should really take a look at a demo that uses it to see how the
 * different parts fit together. If you have the SquidSquad test sources, LightingTest in squidglyph provides a
 * relatively simple example using many colors of light. {@link VisionFramework} also can be used to handle much of the
 * boilerplate associated with vision and lighting.

     * Given a 2D array that will hold Oklab int colors, fills the 2D array with different Oklab colors based on what
     * lights are present in line of sight of the viewer and the various flicker or strobe effects that Radiance light
     * sources can do. You should usually call {@link #update()} before each call to drawOklab(), but you may want to
     * make custom changes to the lighting in between those two calls (that is the only place those changes will be
     * noticed). A common use for this in text-based games uses a GlyphMap's backgrounds field as the parameter.
     * This always mixes the calculated lights in {@link #colorLighting} with the {@link #backgroundColor}, using
     * {@link #lightingStrength} to determine how much the lights should affect the background color.
     * <br>
     * If this class is extended, this method should be considered as one to override.
     * @param backgrounds a 2D int array, which will be modified in-place; visible cells will receive Oklab colors
