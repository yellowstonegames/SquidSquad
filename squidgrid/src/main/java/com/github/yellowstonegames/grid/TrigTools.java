/**
 * Various trigonometric approximations, using a lookup table for sin() and cos(), a non-tabular approximation for
 * sinSmooth() and cosSmooth(), a Padé approximant for tan(), and Taylor series for the inverses of sin(), cos(), and
 * tan(). This supplies variants for radians, degrees, and turns. This also has an atan2() approximation defined with
 * output in radians, degrees, and turns. The lookup-table-based sin() and cos() can be extraordinarily fast if the 64KB
 * table can stay in a processor cache, while the "smooth" approximations may have higher quality but perform less
 * quickly compared to an in-cache lookup table.
 * <br>
 * This is primarily derived from libGDX's MathUtils class. The main new functionalities are the variants that take or
 * return measurements in turns, the now-available {@link #SIN_TABLE} and {@link #SIN_TABLE_D}, and double variants in
 * general. Using the sin table directly has other uses mentioned in its docs (in particular, uniform random unit
 * vectors). Because using a lookup table for sine and cosine has very small "jumps" between what it returns for
 * smoothly increasing inputs, it may be unsuitable for some usage, such as calculating tan() or some statistical code.
 * TrigTools provides sinSmooth(), cosSmooth(), and degree/turn variants of those for when the precision should be high
 * but it is most important to have a smoothly-curving graph of returns. A different smooth approximation is used for
 * tan().
 * <br>
 * MathUtils had its sin and cos methods created by Riven on JavaGaming.org . The asin(), acos(), and atan() methods all
 * use Taylor series approximations from the 1955 research study "Approximations for Digital Computers," by RAND
 * Corporation; though one might think such code would be obsolete over 60 years later, the approximations from that
 * study seem to have higher accuracy and speed than most attempts in later decades, often those aimed at DSP usage.
 * Even older is the basis for sinSmooth() and cosSmooth(); the versions here are updated to be more precise, but are
 * closely related to a 7th-century sine approximation by Bhaskara I. The update was given in
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3886664">this Stack Exchange answer by WimC</a>. Also from Stack Exchange,
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4453027">this Stack Exchange answer by Soonts</a> provided the tan()
 * approximation used here.
