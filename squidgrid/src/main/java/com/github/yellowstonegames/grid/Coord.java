/**
 * A 2D coordinate with (constant) x and y fields. Coord objects are immutable; a single pool of Coord values, with
 * x and y each ranging from -3 to 255, is shared by all users of Coord (the upper limit of 255 can be increased as
 * needed). This pool helps reduce pressure on the garbage collector when many Coord values would have been created for
 * some purpose and quickly discarded; instead of creating a new Coord with a constructor, you use the static method
 * {@link #get(int, int)}, which retrieves an already-existing Coord from the pool if possible, and always returns a
 * usable Coord. This class has various instance methods, but none of them modify the current Coord; if they change
 * anything, they do so by returning another Coord with different x and y values via {@link #get(int, int)}.
 * <br>
 * More on the Coord pool used by this class: Coords can't always be retrieved from the pool; Coord.get() constructs a
 * new Coord if one of x or y is unusually large (greater than 255) or too negative (below -3). The upper limit of 255
 * is not a hard rule; you can increase the limit on the pool by calling {@link #expandPoolTo(int, int)} or
 * {@link #expandPool(int, int)}, which cause more memory to be spent initially on storing Coords but can save memory
 * or ease GC pressure over the long term by preventing duplicate Coords from being created many times. The pool can
 * never shrink because allowing that would cause completely unpredictable results if existing Coords were in use, or
 * could easily cause crashes on Android after resuming an application that had previously shrunken the pool due to
 * platform quirks. Long story short, you should only expand the pool size when your game needs a larger set of 2D
 * points it will commonly use, and in many cases you shouldn't need to change it at all.
 * <br>
 * The x and y fields are internally {@code short}s, since most usage of Coord should use pooled Coord values, and there
 * isn't much of a possible way to store more than 32767x32767 (where 32767 is {@link Short#MAX_VALUE}) Coords in any
 * Java application due to limits on array size. There is also an immutable, precalculated result for
 * {@link #hashCode()} to return without needing to recalculate anything. The precalculated hash won't overlap with the
 * hash for any other Coord as long as all Coord values have x and y each in the range from {@link Short#MIN_VALUE} to
 * {@link Short#MAX_VALUE}. Larger ranges than a 8192x8192 grid of Coord items tend to exhaust all of Java's heap
 * (using only Coord items), so supporting larger sizes isn't at all a priority.
 * <br>
 * This implements {@link Point2}, allowing it to interoperate with some other libraries that also use the interfaces
 * from the library <a href="https://github.com/tommyettinger/crux">crux</a>. A side effect of this is that using the
 * field {@link #x} gets a {@code short} value, while calling {@link #x()} uses the interface and gets a {@code float}.
 * If this causes problems in, for instance, Kotlin code, you could create an extension method that gets the type you
 * want and has the name you want.

     * Also accessible via {@link #hashCode()}, this is a precalculated hashCode() result. It is only assigned when a
     * Coord is first created. It uses a method of computing a hash value that won't collide in full (over all 32 bits)
     * for any possible Coord values. Even using a smaller portion of the hash, if a hash table can fit 8192x8192 Coord
     * values with load factor 0.5f, an appropriate mask will still not cause collisions here. This does randomize the
     * upper bits of the hash somewhat, but the lower bits (where collisions are most important, because masks typically
     * keep only some range of the lower bits) are more orderly.
     * <br>
     * The actual method used to assign this involves passing x and y to the Rosenberg-Strong pairing function, then
     * multiplying that by 0x9E3779B9, or -1640531527 in decimal. The Rosenberg-Strong pairing function is discussed
     * more <a href="https://hbfs.wordpress.com/2018/08/07/moeud-deux/">here (a good introduction)</a> and
     * <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04129">here (a more technical paper)</a>. 0x9E3779B9 is used because it is
     * (2 to the 32) divided by the golden ratio, and because of properties of the golden ratio, 0x9E3779B9 helps ensure
     * "sub-random" bit patterns in its multiples. Because 0x9E3779B9 is odd, if every possible hashCode() is taken and
     * multiplied by 0x9E3779B9, the full set of (2 to the 32) numbers will just be rearranged; nothing will collide.
